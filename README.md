üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è CrewAI Medical Report Analyzer
This project demonstrates a multi-agent system built with CrewAI to analyze medical blood reports. The system automates the process of extracting text from a blood report image, interpreting the results based on standard medical ranges, and generating a simple, patient-friendly summary.

The entire workflow is orchestrated within a Jupyter notebook (med.ipynb).

üß† Core Components (The Crew)
The project is powered by a crew of three specialized AI agents that work together in a sequential process:

OCR Parser Agent:

Role: An OCR specialist.

Task: Extracts raw text from the medical report image.

Health Data Interpreter Agent:

Role: A medical professional who interprets lab results.

Task: Analyzes the raw text to identify key blood parameters and their values, determines if they are Normal, High, or Low, and provides a simple explanation for each.

Summary Generator Agent:

Role: A professional medical writer.

Task: Takes the interpreted data and synthesizes it into a clear, easy-to-read summary report in Markdown format.

üöÄ Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.11 or higher.

Tesseract-OCR: This is a required system-level dependency for the OCR functionality.

Windows: Download the installer. You may need to specify the path to tesseract.exe in your Python script.

macOS: brew install tesseract

Linux: sudo apt install tesseract-ocr

Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine.

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>

Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# On macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

Step 3: Install Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages.

pip install crewai langchain-community pytesseract pillow

Step 4: Configure the LLM API Key
The project uses the Gemini LLM. You need to set your API key as an environment variable. Create a file named .env in the project root directory and add your key:

GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

üìà How to Run the Notebook
Launch Jupyter:

jupyter notebook

Open med.ipynb: In the Jupyter dashboard, navigate to and open the med.ipynb file.

Update the Image Path: If your medical report image is not at ./reports/blood_report.png, update the file path in the ocr_task and the crew.kickoff() method to point to your image.

Run Cells: Execute each cell sequentially. The final output will be a Markdown-formatted report generated by the crew.
